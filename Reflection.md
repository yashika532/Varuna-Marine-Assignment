### 🚀 What I Learned Using AI Agents
Working with AI agents during the FuelEU Maritime project taught me how to efficiently structure a full-stack application under **Hexagonal Architecture**.  
I learned how to delegate repetitive coding tasks—like creating boilerplate routes, model definitions, and documentation—so I could focus on higher-level logic such as compliance calculations and clean domain-driven design.  
AI support also helped in identifying architectural consistency and improving readability across both backend and frontend layers.

### ⚡ Efficiency Gains vs Manual Coding
Using AI reduced development time drastically—what would normally take several days of setup (e.g., writing API documentation, folder structures, and environment configurations) was completed in a few hours.  
Instead of spending time debugging syntax or formatting, I focused on **core business logic** and **data flow consistency**.  
Manual coding would have been slower and more error-prone, while AI helped maintain a consistent coding style and cleaner project organization.

### 🔧 Improvements for Next Time
Next time, I’d:
- Integrate **automated testing early**, to ensure all adapters and ports behave as expected.  
- Use AI more for **code reviews and test generation**, not just for boilerplate.  
- Improve **prompt structuring**—asking for smaller, modular outputs from AI to ensure precision.  
- Explore **AI-assisted deployment workflows** for faster CI/CD setup.

Overall, AI acted as both a coding partner and documentation assistant, improving productivity while maintaining clean and modular code.
